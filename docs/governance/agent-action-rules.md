# Substrate-level agent-action rules engine

**Status:** v0.7.0 7th-form closeout (issues [#691](https://github.com/alphaonedev/ai-memory-mcp/issues/691), [#760](https://github.com/alphaonedev/ai-memory-mcp/issues/760)) — **wired at the harness boundary** across four daemon-side wire-points (`skill_export`, `federation::sync`, `hooks::executor`, `llm`). Seed rules R001-R004 land at `enabled=0` per migration `0024_v07_governance_rules.sql`; the operator activates them via `ai-memory governance install-defaults` or per-rule `ai-memory rules enable <id> --sign`.

## Why this exists — RCA

The K9 governance pipeline (`src/governance/mod.rs`) gates exactly six substrate-INTERNAL operations:

- `memory_store`
- `memory_link`
- `memory_delete`
- `memory_archive`
- `memory_consolidate`
- `memory_replay`

Every operator hard rule that was violated during the v0.7.0 campaign (5-6 occurrences of `/tmp` writes, low-disk `cargo` runs) targeted actions **OUTSIDE** that surface — Bash command execution, filesystem writes outside the substrate, process spawns, network requests. The K9 pipeline had no insertion point to see them.

This module adds a parallel engine — `check_agent_action` — that evaluates a declarative table of typed rules at every external-action entry point.

## Honest enforcement language

There are two boundaries, with distinct guarantees:

| Boundary                            | Guarantee                                                                                                          | Wording                                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Substrate-internal ops              | K9 mechanically applied at the write path. Agent cannot bypass.                                                    | **substrate-authoritative**                   |
| Agent-external ops (Bash / FS / …)  | Rule lives in substrate. Harness PreToolUse hook calls `memory_check_agent_action` and honors the returned decision. | **substrate-rule-bound, harness-mediated**    |

The harness boundary is **mechanical config** (operator-audited `settings.json`); the agent-attention boundary is **probabilistic recall**. Strong directional improvement; not literal "100%."

Capabilities v3 stamps:

```json
{
  "governance": {
    "agent_action_check": "substrate-authoritative-for-internal-ops",
    "rules_immutable_seed": true
  }
}
```

## Agent-EXTERNAL Layer-4 wiring (7th-form closeout)

The four enumerated wire-points (`src/governance/agent_action.rs`
module docs):

| Wire-point                          | AgentAction variant   | File:line                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Skill manifest emission             | `FilesystemWrite`     | `src/mcp/tools/skill_export.rs:162,209`     |
| Federation peer POST                | `NetworkRequest`      | `src/federation/sync.rs:66`                 |
| Hooks subprocess spawn              | `ProcessSpawn`        | `src/hooks/executor.rs:399,783`             |
| LLM (Ollama / OpenAI) HTTP          | `NetworkRequest`      | `src/llm.rs:421`                            |

Each wire-point calls `crate::governance::wire_check::check(&action)`
before issuing the syscall. The daemon `bootstrap_serve` installs ONE
shared closure into the process-wide `GOVERNANCE_PRE_ACTION` OnceLock
that consults `check_agent_action_no_audit` against the live
`governance_rules` table.

### Decision verbs honored at the wire boundary

The substrate rules engine returns one of four primary verdicts
(`Allow` / `Refuse` / `Warn` / `Escalate`); the
wire boundary honors each as follows:

| Verdict     | Wire-boundary behavior                                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Allow**   | `wire_check::check` returns `Ok(())`; the action proceeds.                                              |
| **Refuse**  | Returns `Err(GovernanceRefusal { reason })`; caller short-circuits with HTTP `403 / GOVERNANCE_REFUSED`. |
| **Warn**    | Logged via the audit chain; returns `Ok(())`. The action proceeds; the warning is operator-observable.  |
| **Escalate** | v0.8.0 (#697 / §22 PE-5, schema v66). **Fails closed:** an unresolved `Decision::Escalate` blocks exactly like `Refuse` (`Decision::is_block`) pending human review — the wire boundary returns `Err(GovernanceRefusal { reason })`. |
| **Modify**  | Rules engine pre-rewrites the action's args; the wire boundary sees the modified payload and Allows it. |
| **Ask**     | Future K10 surface — operator-approval queueing. Today reduces to Refuse (action does not proceed).      |

## Schema

Migration `0024_v07_governance_rules.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE governance_rules (
    id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    kind          TEXT NOT NULL,
    matcher       TEXT NOT NULL,             -- per-kind JSON
    severity      TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (severity IN ('refuse','warn','log')),
    reason        TEXT NOT NULL,
    namespace     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '_global',
    created_by    TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    enabled       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    signature     BLOB,
    attest_level  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unsigned'
);
```

> **Schema update (v0.8.0).** The `severity` CHECK above is the original
> migration 0024 (v0.7.0) form. **Schema v66 (#697 / §22 PE-5,
> `migrations/sqlite/0055_v66_governance_rules_escalate_severity.sql`)
> extended it to `CHECK (severity IN ('refuse','warn','log','escalate'))`**
> — the `escalate` severity produces the fail-closed `Decision::Escalate`
> verdict (postgres ships no `governance_rules` table, so the postgres v66
> arm is a version-stamp no-op).

## Per-kind matcher shapes

| `kind`             | Matcher JSON                                       | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bash`             | `{"command_regex":"..."}`                          | Substring match on the command line.                                  |
| `filesystem_write` | `{"glob":"/tmp/**"}`                               | Reuses the substrate glob vocabulary (`*` per-segment, `**` cross-`/`). |
| `network_request`  | `{"host":"evil.example.com"}`                      | Exact host match.                                                     |
| `process_spawn`    | `{"binary":"cargo","disk_free_min_gib":20}`        | Binary name match plus optional disk-threshold refusal.               |
| `custom`           | `{"kind":"<your_kind>"}`                           | Extension point for caller-specific actions.                          |

## Seed rules (land at `enabled=0`)

| ID   | Kind               | Matcher                                            | Why                                                              |
|------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R001 | `filesystem_write` | `{"glob":"/tmp/**"}`                               | Operator hard rule — no `/tmp` writes.                            |
| R002 | `filesystem_write` | `{"glob":"/var/tmp/**"}`                           | Operator hard rule — no `/var/tmp` writes.                        |
| R003 | `filesystem_write` | `{"glob":"/private/tmp/**"}`                       | macOS realpath of `/tmp` — closes the realpath escape hatch.      |
| R004 | `process_spawn`    | `{"binary":"cargo","disk_free_min_gib":20}`        | Refuse `cargo` on low-disk systems (<20 GiB free).                |

**These ship disabled.** macOS treats `/tmp` as a symlink to `/private/tmp`, and many existing scripts/tests assume `/tmp/foo` works. Enabling R001-R003 without a test-fleet audit would break the build.

### Activating seed rules

After running:

```bash
grep -rn "/tmp/" tests/ scripts/ benches/
grep -rn "/private/tmp/" tests/
```

…and resolving every match, the operator has two activation paths.

**One-shot bulk activator (v0.7.0 7th-form, issue #760):**

```bash
ai-memory governance install-defaults           # interactive y/N prompt
ai-memory governance install-defaults --yes     # for CI / scripts
ai-memory governance install-defaults --yes --json
```

Flips `enabled = 1` on every present seed row; does NOT touch the
`signature` column. Outputs `activated`, `already_enabled`, and
`missing` lists so the operator can verify migration 0024 landed.

**Per-rule activation (re-signs the row with the operator key):**

```bash
ai-memory rules enable R001 --sign
ai-memory rules enable R002 --sign
ai-memory rules enable R003 --sign
ai-memory rules enable R004 --sign
```

`rules enable --sign` is the per-rule path that recomputes the
canonical row encoding (including `enabled = 1`) and lands an Ed25519
signature so a direct `UPDATE governance_rules SET enabled = 1` after
the fact fails verification at load time (`canonical_bytes_for_signing`
commits to `enabled`).

### Audit-honest framing

This is **mechanical at the harness hook boundary**, NOT at the agent
attention boundary. The wire-up upgrade from the "callable but
un-wired" v0.7.0 fold-1 state to the wired-at-the-boundary 7th-form
state means:

1. Every daemon-side external action consults `governance_rules`
   before issuing the syscall.
2. A `refuse` rule short-circuits the action with a typed
   `GovernanceRefusal { reason }` that the upstream HTTP / MCP layer
   maps to `403 / GOVERNANCE_REFUSED`.
3. Activation is by operator decision — the seed rows ship inert so
   migrations don't regress existing scripts that assume `/tmp` works.

The wiring guarantee does NOT extend to harness-side Bash invocations
unless the operator has installed the Claude Code PreToolUse hook
documented in `docs/integrations/claude-code.md`. That hook is a
SEPARATE operator-installable surface. Since #1811 it is installed as a
`type: command` wrapper (`ai-memory governance check-action
--from-pretool-stdin`) that consults the same substrate rules table —
**not** a `type: mcp_tool` hook, because an `mcp_tool` hook cannot block
the proposed tool call (an `isError`/non-decision response is
non-blocking under the Claude Code hooks contract).

`--sign` requires the operator's Ed25519 keypair at `${AI_MEMORY_KEY_DIR:-~/.config/ai-memory/keys}/operator.priv` (mode 0600). Without it the CLI refuses with `governance.no_operator_key`.

## Operator identity

The operator is identified by a keypair on disk:

| File                         | Mode (Unix) | Contents                            |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| `<key-dir>/operator.pub`     | `0644`      | 32 raw bytes — `VerifyingKey::to_bytes()` |
| `<key-dir>/operator.priv`    | `0600`      | 32 raw bytes — `SigningKey::to_bytes()`   |

Default `<key-dir>` is `~/.config/ai-memory/keys/` (override with `AI_MEMORY_KEY_DIR` or `--key-dir`). Generation:

```bash
ai-memory identity generate --agent-id operator
```

## Mutation gate by surface

| Surface | Read (`list` / `check`)          | Mutation (`add` / `enable` / `disable` / `remove`)                                                   |
|---------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CLI     | Unprivileged                     | Requires `--sign`; loads `operator.priv` from disk.                                                  |
| HTTP    | Unprivileged                     | Requires `X-AI-Memory-Operator-Signature` header; verified against `operator.pub` on disk.            |
| MCP     | Tools `memory_check_agent_action` + `memory_rule_list` | **Explicitly disabled** — mutation tools are NOT registered. Returns `governance.not_available_over_mcp` if a future caller invokes one. |

This split is per design revision 2026-05-13 (issue #691 comment). The rationale: MCP stdio is the agent-facing channel; rule mutation must remain operator-only because a compromised agent must not be able to weaken its own constraints.

## What is *not* in this commit (deliberate)

- **`storage::insert` does NOT consult `check_agent_action`.** The wiring lands in a follow-up PR after the operator runs the test-fleet audit. This commit ships the engine and the audit chain; the substrate write paths still flow through K9 only.
- **`~/.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse hook is NOT installed** *(in this original #691 commit)*. The operator installs the hook after reviewing the new MCP tools — a Restricted action. (The PE-2 installer that wires this shipped later; since #1811 the installed hook is a `type: command` wrapper — `{"type":"command","command":"ai-memory governance check-action --from-pretool-stdin"}` — **not** the originally-envisioned `{"type":"mcp_tool","tool":"memory_check_agent_action"}`, because an `mcp_tool` hook cannot block.)
- **No GitHub issue closure, no priority-10 verdict memory.** Operator does these after diff review.

## Audit chain

Every `check_agent_action` call appends one row to `signed_events` with:

- `event_type = "governance.check"`
- `agent_id` = the caller (NHI vocabulary)
- `payload_hash` = SHA-256 over the canonical `{action, decision}` JSON
- `timestamp` = RFC3339 UTC

Auditors filter on `event_type = 'governance.check'` to replay every external-action decision the daemon ever made.

## Test surface

- `tests/governance_agent_action.rs` — matcher types, decision routing, audit-event emission
- `tests/governance_singleton.rs` — 100-concurrent-check consistency
- `tests/governance_immutability.rs` — non-operator mutation refused; MCP wire-string stability
- `tests/governance_sandbox_boundary.rs` — every variant has a working refusal path
- `tests/governance_a2a_rules.rs` — peer A authors → replicated to peer B → peer B enforces
- `src/governance/agent_action.rs` (unit) — 21 tests covering matchers + audit + decision combinators
- `src/governance/rules_store.rs` (unit) — 13 tests covering CRUD + canonical encoding
